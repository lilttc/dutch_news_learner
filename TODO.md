- [x] Status buttons in Streamlit Vocabulary tab
- [x] "Hide known words" checkbox (default on)

### Phase 4B: Next.js Migration (Mar 15 PM)
- [x] FastAPI REST API (`src/api/`)
  - `GET /api/episodes` — list with vocab counts
  - `GET /api/episodes/{id}` — detail with segments, vocabulary, articles
  - `GET /api/vocabulary/status` — user word statuses
  - `PUT /api/vocabulary/{id}/status` — update word status
  - `GET /api/health`
- [x] Next.js + TypeScript + Tailwind project (`frontend/`)

- [x] Buy Me a Coffee account created

### Phase 4D: Code Quality + Deployment (Mar 16)
- [x] Fix N+1 query in `list_episodes` — subquery with `func.count`
- [x] Fix DB engine singleton in `deps.py` — avoid recreating engine per request
- [x] Fix CORS wildcard — use `allow_origin_regex` for `*.vercel.app`
- [x] Dictionary: converted 63MB JSON to SQLite for memory-efficient lookups
- [x] Created `requirements-api.txt` (slim deps, excludes spaCy)
- [x] Deployed FastAPI to Render (free tier) — works but cold starts are slow
- [x] Deployed Next.js to Vercel — connected to GitHub, auto-deploys on push
- [x] Segment translations added for latest 5 episodes (OpenAI)
- [x] Add Buy Me a Coffee link to Streamlit sidebar
- [x] Fix stale DB on Streamlit Cloud — re-copy on start + 1-hour cache TTL
- [x] Removed `dutch_glosses.json` from git tracking (replaced by SQLite)

---

## Current Status

**Streamlit app** = primary public app (live, fast, reliable)
**Next.js + Vercel** = staging/demo (deployed, looks great, but Render free tier has slow cold starts)

The Next.js frontend is ready for production. The blocker is backend hosting:
Render free tier spins down after 15 min → 30-50s cold starts → bad UX.
To promote Next.js to primary: either pay $7/mo for Render Starter, or migrate to
Phase 6 (Postgres + proper hosting). Not urgent — Streamlit serves well for now.

---

## Pick Up Here (Mar 19)

### Phase 6A: Database Migration to Cloud Postgres ✅ DONE
Migrated from SQLite to Neon Postgres. Pipeline and Streamlit now use `DATABASE_URL`.

- [x] **Choose provider** — Neon (free tier)
- [x] **Set up cloud Postgres** — Neon instance, connection string in `.env`
- [x] **Update `get_engine()`** — reads `DATABASE_URL`, SQLite fallback for local dev
- [x] **Adapt `_migrate_schema()`** — `_pg_add_column` for conditional ALTER, Postgres-compatible DDL
- [x] **Write migration script** — `scripts/migrate_to_postgres.py` (batch inserts, idempotent)
- [x] **Dictionary** — kept as local SQLite (read-only, not migrated)
- [x] **Update secrets** — Streamlit Cloud `DATABASE_URL`, `.env` for local
- [x] **Test end-to-end** — pipeline writes to Postgres, Streamlit reads from Postgres
- [x] **Remove `data/dutch_news.db` from git** — gitignored
- [x] **Lock contention fix** — conditional migrations, `check_locks.py`, `kill_stuck_connections.py`
- [x] **Incremental pipeline** — each step only processes episodes needing it (default)

### Phase 6B: GitHub Actions Pipeline Automation ✅ DONE
Pipeline runs in CI via GitHub Actions. See `docs/GITHUB_ACTIONS_SETUP.md` for details.

- [x] **Create `.github/workflows/daily_pipeline.yml`**
      — Python 3.11, pip cache, spaCy nl_core_news_md
      — Schedule: weekdays */15 18-20 UTC, weekends 18:15 UTC
      — Manual trigger: workflow_dispatch
- [x] **Update `run_pipeline.sh`** — check OPENAI_API_KEY from env or .env (CI-friendly)
- [x] **README/TODO** — note automatic pipeline, de-emphasize cron
- [ ] **Store secrets in GitHub** — `DATABASE_URL`, `YOUTUBE_API_KEY`, `OPENAI_API_KEY` (user action)
- [ ] **Test** — trigger workflow manually, verify new episode in app (user action)

### Per-User Vocabulary — Option A (Quick Fix) ✅ DONE
Implemented localStorage for Next.js so each visitor has their own known/learning status on their device.

- [x] **Next.js: localStorage** — Status stored in browser (`dutch_news_vocab_status`). No API calls for status. User-facing note: "Status saved in this browser — yours alone."
- [x] **Streamlit: stays shared** — Python/server-side cannot access localStorage. Added caption directing users to Next.js for per-device storage. Streamlit Cloud remains shared (user_id=1).
- [ ] **Reddit responses** — User action: post draft replies from `docs/REDDIT_RESPONSE_GUIDE.md`

### Per-User Vocabulary — Phase 6E ✅ DONE, Phase 6F Next
Phase 6E (anonymous sessions) implemented. Preferred UX: Phase 6F (email auth) — no need to explain sessions to users.

- [x] **Phase 6E: Anonymous sessions** — Token in localStorage (Next.js) or URL `?u=<token>` (Streamlit). API `X-Session-Token`, maps to user_id. UserVocabulary per-session.
- [ ] **Phase 6F: Email auth** — Sign up with email; progress saved everywhere. See Phase 6F section below. Branch: `feat/phase-6f-email-auth`.

### Reddit Feedback — Bugs to Fix (This Week)

Posted on r/learndutch; received positive feedback + concrete bug reports. See `docs/REDDIT_RESPONSE_GUIDE.md` for response drafts.

- [x] **Related reading: missing spaces** (Aandeelhouder) — Fixed in `fix_concatenated_spaces()` (Streamlit + Next.js).
<<<<<<< Updated upstream
- [ ] **Vocabulary status buttons: page freeze** (Aandeelhouder) — Clicking learning/known causes UI to freeze. Deferred to tomorrow. Caused by `st.rerun()` after each status change; optimize (e.g. batch updates, loading state, or defer full rerun).
=======
- [x] **Vocabulary status buttons: page freeze** (Aandeelhouder) — Addressed: `@st.fragment` + `on_click` + scoped status query (Mar 2026). Re-open if regressions on Streamlit Cloud.
>>>>>>> Stashed changes
- [ ] **Mobile/Android: empty page** (Humoer) — Streamlit shows empty page on Android browsers. Investigate Streamlit mobile compatibility; consider fallback message or PWA.
- [x] **Filter UX: radio button** (anyalitica) — Replaced checkbox with radio: "Hide known" | "Show all" (Streamlit + Next.js).

### Product Ideas (Reddit + Suggestions) — Prioritization

| Idea | Status | Short-run (This Week) | Long-run |
|------|--------|----------------------|----------|
| Save words to personal review list | ✅ Exists | — | Enhance: dedicated "Review" view, better surfacing |
| Mark episode as done + streak/history | New | — | Add `EpisodeProgress` / streak tracking |
| Mini summary: 1-sentence NL + EN | New | — | LLM: episode summary (Dutch + English); display in header |
| Difficulty labels (episode/sentence) | New | — | CEFR or frequency-based; integrate Subtlex-NL later |
| "Listen first, reveal later" mode | New | — | Hide transcript by default; reveal on click/toggle |
| Daily review from yesterday's words | Partial | Polish quiz to emphasize yesterday's saved words | — |
| Known words storage (per-user) | 6E done | Next.js + Streamlit: anonymous sessions | Phase 6F: email auth (preferred UX) |

**Short-run focus (today–this week):**
1. ~~Fix related reading spaces bug~~ ✅ Done
2. ~~Radio button for hide/show known words~~ ✅ Done
3. ~~Per-user vocab: Option A (localStorage for Next.js)~~ ✅ Done
4. Respond to Reddit comments (user action)
5. Fix vocabulary status freeze (deferred to tomorrow)

**Long-run roadmap adjustments:**
- Add **Episode progress + streak** to backlog (high impact, medium effort)
- Add **Listen first mode** to backlog (high impact, small effort)
- Add **Mini summary** to backlog (medium impact, medium effort — LLM)
- **Mobile UX** moved up: Streamlit polish for mobile, or document limitations

### Phase 6E: Anonymous Sessions ✅ DONE
Upgrade path from Option A (localStorage). Gives per-user vocab with persistence across visits, no login.
Implemented — token in localStorage (Next.js) or URL param (Streamlit). UserVocabulary uses per-session user_id.

### Phase 6F: Email Auth (Per-User Vocabulary — Preferred UX)

**Why:** Users shouldn't need to understand sessions (URL tokens, bookmarking, localStorage). Email signup gives a simple story: "Create account → your progress is saved everywhere." No explaining where data lives.

**Branch:** `feat/phase-6f-email-auth` (create after merging `feat/phase-6e-anonymous-sessions`)

#### Commit 1: Database + models
- [ ] Add `User` table: `id`, `email` (unique, indexed), `password_hash`, `created_at`
- [ ] Add migration: `users` table, `UserVocabulary.user_id` FK to `users.id` (or keep linking via new `user_id` column; `users.id` becomes the user_id for UserVocabulary)
- [ ] Reserve `user_id=1` for legacy/anonymous; `user_id=2+` = registered users. `AnonymousSession` ids can stay separate — migration: when user signs up, copy `AnonymousSession`/legacy UserVocabulary rows to the new `User`'s id, then optionally delete anonymous rows
- [ ] Export `User` from `src.models`

#### Commit 2: Auth backend (FastAPI)
- [ ] Choose auth lib: **FastAPI Users** (https://fastapi-users.github.io) or **Authlib** + JWT, or hand-roll with `passlib` + `python-jose`
- [ ] `POST /api/auth/register` — email + password; hash with bcrypt/argon2; create User; return session token or set cookie
- [ ] `POST /api/auth/login` — email + password; verify; return JWT or set HTTP-only cookie
- [ ] `POST /api/auth/logout` — clear session
- [ ] `GET /api/auth/me` — return current user (email, id) if authenticated
- [ ] Auth dependency: `get_current_user(request) -> User | None`; protect vocab/episode routes — if authenticated, use `user.id`; else fall back to `X-Session-Token` (anonymous) or `user_id=1` (legacy)
- [ ] Add `SECRET_KEY`, `JWT_ALGORITHM` (or similar) to env

#### Commit 3: Next.js auth UI
- [ ] Auth context: `useAuth()` — `user`, `login`, `register`, `logout`, `loading`
- [ ] Login page: `/login` — email + password form, call `POST /api/auth/login`
- [ ] Register page: `/register` — email + password, call `POST /api/auth/register`
- [ ] Header: show "Log in" / "Sign up" when anonymous; show "Log out" + email when authenticated
- [ ] Persist session: JWT in `localStorage` or HTTP-only cookie (cookie is more secure; requires API to set it)
- [ ] Send `Authorization: Bearer <token>` on API requests when logged in; backend prefers Bearer over `X-Session-Token`
- [ ] Migrate anonymous progress: on first login after using app anonymously, offer "Merge your progress?" — call API to copy `AnonymousSession` UserVocabulary to `User` id

#### Commit 4: Streamlit auth (optional)
- [ ] Streamlit has no native auth; options: (a) **Streamlit-Authenticator** (`pip install streamlit-authenticator`), (b) embed login in iframe and pass token via query param, (c) client-side only for Next.js; Streamlit stays anonymous with URL token
- [ ] If supporting Streamlit auth: add login form in sidebar; store JWT in `st.session_state`; send token to API if Streamlit ever calls API directly, or keep Streamlit server-side DB access and use `User` id from session

#### Migration path (anonymous → registered)
- [ ] When user registers: optionally pass `anonymous_token` (or `X-Session-Token`) in request; backend copies `UserVocabulary` rows from anonymous user_id to new User id; delete or leave anonymous rows
- [ ] Document in README: "Sign up to save progress across devices"

#### Security notes
- [ ] Password: min 8 chars; use bcrypt or argon2
- [ ] Rate-limit login/register (e.g. 5 attempts/min per IP)
- [ ] Email verification (optional for MVP): send link to verify; mark `User.email_verified`

### Phase 6D: VPN Integration for Transcript Fetch (Geo-Restriction)
GitHub Actions runners are typically in the US; NOS transcripts may be geo-restricted.
Integrate NordVPN in the workflow so ingest runs from a Netherlands IP.

- [ ] **Add NordVPN step to workflow** — connect to NL server before ingest
- [ ] **Store NordVPN credentials** — add `NORDVPN_SERVICE_USERNAME`, `NORDVPN_SERVICE_PASSWORD` as repo secrets (or use token-based auth if supported)
- [ ] **Wrap ingest in VPN** — run only ingest + transcript fetch steps inside VPN; disconnect before remaining steps
- [ ] **Test** — verify transcript fetch succeeds in CI
- [ ] **Document** — update `docs/GITHUB_ACTIONS_SETUP.md` with VPN setup

### Phase 6C: Test Suite + CI
Add tests and run them automatically on every push/PR. Catches regressions
before they reach prod and demonstrates CI/CD skills.

- [ ] **Set up pytest** — `tests/` directory, `pytest.ini` or `pyproject.toml` config
- [ ] **Unit tests: quiz generator** — question type selection, distractor picking,
      frequency filter, masking, answer checking. Pure functions, easy to test.
- [ ] **Unit tests: vocabulary processing** — separable verb recombination,
      extraction with known edge cases
- [ ] **Integration tests: FastAPI endpoints** — use `TestClient`, test episode list,
      episode detail, quiz generate/submit, vocabulary status update
- [ ] **DB fixtures** — in-memory SQLite for test isolation (no cloud DB needed)
- [ ] **Create `.github/workflows/test.yml`**
      — trigger: on push to any branch + on pull request
      — install deps, run `pytest --cov` with coverage report
      — fail PR if tests fail
- [ ] **Add coverage badge to README** (optional, nice-to-have)

### Phase 5C: Quiz System (on `quiz-improvements` branch)
Initial quiz code is on main. Improvements (frequency filter, all-MC, English
translations, skip known words) are in progress on a feature branch.
Merge to main when polished.

- [ ] Fix frequency filter — skip words appearing in >30% of episodes (too basic)
- [ ] All questions are MC — cloze uses word options, not text input
- [ ] English-only translations for NL→EN / EN→NL questions (dictionary `gloss_en`)
- [ ] Skip "known" words in episode quiz
- [ ] Session cache invalidation when quiz format changes
- [ ] Consider: integrate frequency list (Subtlex-NL or similar) for CEFR-level targeting
- [ ] Consider: dbt transformation layer for quiz analytics (words learned/week, score trends)

### Backlog

**Transcript & Bubbles:**
- [ ] Merge subtitle segments into sentences (group by punctuation, not by second)
- [ ] Show infinitive/base form in vocabulary bubble when clicked word is conjugated
      (data already exists: `VocabularyItem.lemma`; display change only)
- [ ] Transcript auto-scroll with video playback (high effort)

**Dictionary Quality:**
- [ ] Fill missing `gloss_en` — LLM pass specifically targeting words without English translation
- [ ] Validate dictionary entries — reject garbage (meaning = single inflected form,
      example = just the word itself, e.g. "helftes" → meaning "helft", example "helftes.")
- [ ] Idiom detection + dictionary (Phase 7) — multi-word expressions, spaCy Matcher
      or curated Dutch idiom list. High learning value for users.

**Platform:**
- [ ] Clickable calendar view for episode selection by date
- [ ] Streamlit polish: welcome message, episode count, mobile UX
- [ ] User system: email auth, per-user vocabulary (Phase 6F)
- [ ] Phase 6E: Anonymous sessions (per-user vocab without auth; upgrade from localStorage)
- [ ] Hosting upgrade: promote Next.js to primary, retire Streamlit
- [ ] Analytics: Vercel Analytics, PostHog, learning event tracking

**Reddit / Product Ideas (new):**
- [ ] Episode progress: mark as done, streak counter, watch history
- [ ] Mini summary: one-sentence Dutch + English per episode (LLM)
- [ ] "Listen first, reveal later" mode — hide transcript by default
- [ ] Difficulty labels per episode (CEFR or frequency-based)

<<<<<<< Updated upstream
=======
### Next step: Vocabulary export + learner sentence (proposed)

High value for active learners: export words with definitions and examples, optional personal sentence per word (e.g. for Anki / spreadsheet review).

- [ ] **Schema** — Add nullable `user_sentence` (or `learner_note`) on `user_vocabulary` (per user + vocabulary_id); migration in `_migrate_schema`
- [ ] **API** — `PATCH /api/vocabulary/{id}/note` or extend status body; `GET /api/vocabulary/export?status=known|learning|new|all` → CSV or JSON (columns: lemma, pos, status, meaning_nl, meaning_en, episode_example, user_sentence, optional episode_id/title)
- [ ] **Streamlit** — In vocabulary expander: short text area for “My sentence”; “Download CSV” with status filter (reuse export query or `pandas`/stdlib CSV)
- [ ] **Next.js** — Same UX: note field + export button (logged-in / token users)
- [ ] **Definition / sentence source** — Join `VocabularyItem` + dictionary; episode example: pick one from `EpisodeVocabulary.example_sentence` (latest or first seen) or leave blank when aggregated across episodes
- [ ] **Later** — Dedicated “My vocabulary” page, Anki `.apkg` export (see UX table: Export to Anki)

**Suggested branch:** `feat/vocab-export-learner-notes`

## Phase 7: AI Features

- [ ] RAG-based episode search (semantic search with embeddings, pgvector or ChromaDB)
- [ ] AI-generated vocabulary explanations (context-aware, not just dictionary)
- [ ] Personalized difficulty scoring per user
- [ ] Streaming LLM responses in quiz explanations (SSE)

## Session Notes

### Mar 14, 2026
- Translation toggle, related reading, topic extraction, documentation

### Mar 15, 2026
- UX: tab layout, bubble fix, vocab limit, dictionary enrichment (EN Wiktionary)
- Related Reading: switched from Google CSE (403 issues) to DuckDuckGo with retry/backoff
- Pipeline automation: `run_pipeline.sh`
- Known words: `UserVocabulary` model + Streamlit UI
- Next.js migration: FastAPI API (5 endpoints), Next.js frontend (8 source files)
- Vercel Analytics + Buy Me a Coffee wired up
- Anonymized repo, pushed to GitHub (public)
- Deployed to Streamlit Community Cloud (fixed read-only SQLite)
- Buy Me a Coffee account: https://buymeacoffee.com/lilttc

### Mar 16, 2026
- Code review + onboarding with senior engineer
- Backend fixes: N+1 query (subquery), engine singleton, CORS regex
- Dictionary: converted 63MB JSON → SQLite for memory-efficient Render deployment
- Created `requirements-api.txt` (excludes spaCy for lighter API deploys)
- Deployed Next.js to Vercel + FastAPI to Render (free tier)
- Lesson learned: Render free tier (512MB RAM, cold starts) not sufficient for
  production — Streamlit remains primary app until Phase 6 (Postgres + paid hosting)
- Added segment translations for latest episodes
- **User testing:** found missing definitions (inflected forms), separable verbs
  not detected, requested video-timestamp seeking
- Revised roadmap: vocabulary quality is top priority (blocks quiz system)
- Added Buy Me a Coffee link to Streamlit sidebar
- Fixed stale DB cache on Streamlit Cloud (re-copy on start + TTL)
- Removed `dutch_glosses.json` from git (replaced by SQLite version)

### Mar 17, 2026
- **Phase 5A: Vocabulary quality** (code + execution)
  - `scripts/enrich_vocab_llm.py` — batch GPT-4o-mini enrichment for words the
    dictionary misses. 25 words/batch, POS + example sentence context. Fills
    `VocabularyItem.translation` for inflected forms, rare words.
  - `SeparableVerbRecombiner` — detects split separable verbs via spaCy dep
    parsing + end-of-clause heuristic. Validates against dictionary to prevent
    false positives. Integrated into VocabularyExtractor.
  - Updated `extract_vocabulary.py` to pass dictionary to extractor.
  - Updated `run_pipeline.sh` from 5 → 7 steps (dictionary + LLM enrichment).
  - Ran all scripts on all episodes — vocabulary quality significantly improved.
- **Phase 5B: Timestamp seeking**
  - Streamlit: transcript component uses `window.parent.document` to find YouTube
    iframe, sends `postMessage` commands (`seekTo` + `playVideo`). Fallback to new tab.
  - Next.js: iframe ref in EpisodeView, `seekTo` callback passed to Transcript.
  - Both: `enablejsapi=1` on embed URL.
- Updated README (roadmap, project structure, tech stack, features, quick start)
- Updated ARCHITECTURE (enrichment chain, separable verbs, data model ERD,
  processing module, API layer, dependencies, design decisions)
- **Phase 5C: Quiz system** — initial implementation shipped to main:
  - DB models: `QuizSession` + `QuizItem` with migrations
  - Generator: `src/quiz/generator.py` — template-based, 3 question types
    (NL→EN, EN→NL, sentence fill-in), episode quiz + daily review
  - Streamlit: Quiz tab on episode page + Daily Review button in sidebar
  - FastAPI: `GET /api/quiz/episode/{id}`, `GET /api/quiz/daily`, `POST /api/quiz/submit`
  - Next.js: `Quiz.tsx` component + API types
- **Quiz user testing** — found issues:
  - Mixed Dutch/English definitions in MC options
  - Cloze (text input) too difficult → should be MC
  - Too many questions (10 → 5)
  - Basic words (vandaag, doen) shouldn't be quizzed
  - Started fixes: frequency filter, all-MC, dictionary gloss_en for English
  - Decision: move quiz improvements to `quiz-improvements` branch
- **Reprioritized roadmap:**
  - Phase 6A (DB migration to cloud Postgres) promoted to top priority
  - Phase 6B (GitHub Actions pipeline) follows immediately after
  - Quiz improvements continue on branch, merge when ready
  - Considering AWS/Azure for Postgres (CV value: Azure, dbt potential)

### Mar 18–19, 2026
- **Phase 6A: Postgres migration** (Neon)
  - `get_engine()` reads `DATABASE_URL`, SQLite fallback
  - `_pg_add_column()` for conditional ALTER (avoids lock contention)
  - `migrate_to_postgres.py` — batch inserts, idempotent
  - Streamlit Cloud: removed /tmp copy hack, uses DATABASE_URL
  - Switched to channel uploads playlist (UUch2JvY2ZSwcjf5gb93HGQw)
- **Lock contention fix:** Multiple processes running old ALTER TABLE caused deadlocks.
  - Conditional migrations via information_schema check
  - Pool-level lock_timeout reset on connect
  - `check_locks.py`, `kill_stuck_connections.py` for diagnostics
- **Incremental pipeline:** Each step defaults to "only process what's missing"
  - extract_vocabulary: episodes with no episode_vocabulary
  - translate_segments: episodes with untranslated segments
  - extract_topics: episodes missing topics
  - fetch_related_articles: already incremental

### Mar 19, 2026 (continued)
- **Phase 6B: GitHub Actions**

- **Reddit r/learndutch** — Posted for feedback, ~12h ago
  - Positive reception (Dank je wel, "geweldige tool", "exactly what I was looking for")
  - Bug reports: Related reading missing spaces; vocabulary status buttons cause freeze; Android empty page
  - UX suggestion: radio button for hide/show known words
  - Question: known words storage (currently shared, no auth)
- **Product ideas** — Mapped to TODO: episode done + streak, mini summary, listen-first mode, difficulty labels
- **Prioritization** — Short-run: fix bugs, respond to Reddit; long-run: episode streak, listen-first, mini summary
- **fix/reddit-feedback branch** — Related reading spaces fix, radio button filter
- **Per-user vocab (Option A)** — localStorage for Next.js (per-device); Streamlit stays shared with caption. Future: Phase 6E anonymous sessions.
